# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Results
## üõ†Ô∏è Description
In this project, I‚Äôll applied the skills I learned from "Introduction to Python" and "Intermediate Python" from Datacamp to solve a real-world data science problem. I investigated and discovered if Netflix‚Äôs movies are getting shorter over time, using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

This project helps me gain experience in an essential data science skill ‚Äî exploratory data analysis, which allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data.
